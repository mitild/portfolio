# Welcome to my Portfolio

As a Frontend Developer with a background in Graphic Design, I believed it would be a good idea to combine both professional aspects in one place, My Portfolio.

You will find here my most relevant experience from the last few years, and I will try to keep updating the website with my latest projects and works.

My goals in creating this app have been:

To allow you to get to know me better, bringing together all my experience and passion in one place.
To showcase my voice and design style.
To demonstrate a bit of my skills.
To inspire others.
I hope you enjoy it!

All the best!

Juanma
